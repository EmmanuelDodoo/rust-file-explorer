# Rust File Explorer

## Description

A version of Microsoft Window's file explorer built with Rust and Tauri. I decided to try my hands on this project after watching and liking this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z60f2g-COJY&list=WL&index=1&pp=gAQBiAQB) on Youtube by [Conaticus](https://www.youtube.com/@conaticus). Go check it out!

## Planned Features/ Goals:

- **Smooth Interface**: The application offers a polished and intuitive interface, ensuring a seamless user experience while interacting with ChatGPT.

- **Blazingly fast Searches**: This application will perform far better and faster when searching for files/folders as compared to the native File Explorer.

## Ultimate Goals:

- **Previews**: Previews of all files just like with the native explorer

- **File Explorer Replacement**: I hope this project reaches a point where it can comfortably replace the native file explorer with no tradeoffs.

## Contributing

At this moment, I want to use this project to gain gain some experience with Tauri and especially Rust so contributions are closed. However, should the project expand past the set goals above, Contributions will be allowed.
